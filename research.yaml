- title: Inferring Concept Drift Without Labeled Data Test
  description: Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain
    change over time causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally
    achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining
    pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this
    approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic
    constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches
    for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible.
